This data consists of categorical variables and free form text. In this repository, I have performed the following<br>
1. Topic modeling on free form text
2. Performed Bagging and Boosting models 
3. 1 D Convolutional Neural Network on the dataset.
4. Comparison of all the approaches. 

Kindly go through the presentation I made on my analysis. Also, if you have any queries about the approach I took on topic modeling. Refer to my blog on Topic modeling.
